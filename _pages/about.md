As of April 2022, I am a Full Professor at the [Computer Science Department](https://www.di.uniroma1.it/en/department) of [Sapienza University of Rome](https://www.uniroma1.it), Italy. My research focus is on theoretical and applied cryptography.

Prior to joining Sapienza University I was an Assistant Professor in the Department of Information Engineering and Computer Science [(DISI)](https://www.disi.unitn.it/it) at [University of Trento](https://www.unitn.it), Italy, and a Postdoctoral Fellowship at Sapienza University and [Aarhus University](https://cs.au.dk) (take also a look [here](https://www.cs.au.dk/~orlandi/cryptogroup/)), under the guidance of [Giuseppe Ateniese](https://ateniese.github.io), [Ivan Damg√•rd](https://cs.au.dk/~ivan/) and [Jesper Buus Nielsen](https://pure.au.dk/portal/en/persons). During my PhD, I had the wonderful fortune of visiting [CWI](https://www.cwi.nl/en/) in Amsterdam, hosted by [Ronald Cramer](https://homepages.cwi.nl/~cramer/) and working under the guidance of [Krzysztof Piertzak](https://ist.ac.at/en/research/pietrzak-group/).
