As of April 2022, I am a Full Professor at the Computer Science Department of Sapienza University of Rome, Italy. My research focus is on theoretical and applied cryptography.

Prior to joining Sapienza University of Rome, from April 2016 to December 2016, I was an Assistant Professor in the Department of Information Engineering and Computer Science (DISI) at University of Trento, Italy. Before that, from January 2012 to March 2016, I was a Postdoctoral Fellowship at Sapienza University of Rome and Aarhus University (take a look here), under the guidance of Giuseppe Ateniese, Ivan Damg√•rd and Jesper Buus Nielsen.

In December 2011, I got my PhD at the School of Information Engineering and Telecommunications, at the Department of Information Engineering, Electronics and Telecommunications (DIET) at Sapienza Unveristy of Rome. During my PhD, I had the wonderful fortune of visiting CWI in Amsterdam, hosted by Ronald Cramer and working under the guidance of Krzysztof Piertzak.

I got my Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering at ROMA TRE and my Master's degree in Telecommunication Engineering at Sapienza University.
