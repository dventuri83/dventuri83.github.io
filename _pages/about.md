As of April 2022, I am a Full Professor at the Computer Science Department of Sapienza University of Rome, Italy. My research focus is on theoretical and applied cryptography.

Prior to joining Sapienza University I was an Assistant Professor in the Department of Information Engineering and Computer Science (DISI) at University of Trento, Italy, and a Postdoctoral Fellowship at Sapienza University and Aarhus University (take a look here), under the guidance of Giuseppe Ateniese, Ivan Damg√•rd and Jesper Buus Nielsen. During my PhD, I had the wonderful fortune of visiting CWI in Amsterdam, hosted by Ronald Cramer and working under the guidance of Krzysztof Piertzak.
